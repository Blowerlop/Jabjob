## Game Rules and Phases

### Scoring

A game lasts 5 minutes and to win one, you need to be the highest-ranked player in terms of score. To score, all you have to do is make eliminations, assists and not die too many times. There is also a special rule awarding victory to the first player with 30 or more eliminations.

### Warm up

After launching the game, all players are teleported to warm up rooms for 30s. Here you will find a summary of the rules and mechanics of the game.

### First Phase

Each player is randomly teleported onto the map wearing their invisible cloak. Note that invisibility gradually deteriorates over time, so you'll be able to see your opponents better.

### Second Phase
